# Gold Badge Challenges

## General info

> These Gold Badge Challenges are the final product of the Eleven Fifty Gold Badge. The three challenges I chose, Badges, Cafe, and Outings, represent my work on creating a repository pattern for completing the Gold Badge. I crafted these challenges in the same repository pattern of Name_Console, Name_Repo, and Name_RepoTests that we learned in class and allowed for abstraction and encapsulation. I was able to go through the challenges with less assistance than I expected as I understood how to construct the skeleton of each requirement after reviewing notes from class. All of my programs are working to the specifications of the challenges and included seeded content so they can be updated or checked from the start, all menus run as intended and the basic patterns follow CRUD methodology. Additionally, all of my Unit Tests run and return true, and having to build three sets of them for this project allowed me to better understand the Triple AAA testing pattern of Arrange, Act, Assert.

Project is: _finished_ as I have completed the necessary three projects for this final challenge and feel satisfied with my work.
