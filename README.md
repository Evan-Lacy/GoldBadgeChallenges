# Gold Badge Challenges

## General info

> These Gold Badge Challenges are the final product of the Eleven Fifty Gold Badge. The three challenges I chose, Badges, Cafe, and Outings, represent my work on creating a repository pattern for completing the Gold Badge. I crafted these challenges in the same repository pattern of Name_Console, Name_Repo, and Name_RepoTests that we learned in class and allowed for abstraction and encapsulation. I was able to go through the challenges with less assistance than I expected as I understood how to construct the skeleton of each requirement after reviewing notes from class. All of my programs are working to the specifications of the challenges and included seeded content so they can be updated or checked from the start, all menus run as intended and the basic patterns follow CRUD methodology. Additionally, all of my Unit Tests run and return true, and having to build three sets of them for this project allowed me to better understand the Triple AAA testing pattern of Arrange, Act, Assert.

> As it stands, I am proud of my work with these assignments and I am grateful to my instructors and the teaching assistants in the Eleven Fifty Academy. The .NET Software Developer 69 Cohort is a group that fosters communal growth and reflection, as we all talk with each other to share ideas on projects, discuss our problems and help troubleshoot them for each other, and it has bolstered not just my self-confidence in my coding abilities but also my knowledge level of things I already had some knowledge of and granted me more than I could hope to have found on my own over the course of a month.
